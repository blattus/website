Hi! I'm Roshan. I live in San Francisco and work on [Stripe Terminal](https://stripe.com/terminal) after a few years at [Index](https://www.index.com). Prior to that I lived in Washington, D.C. and worked at IBM where I consulted for public utilities.

I graduated from Duke in 2012 with a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering. I grew up up in Charlotte, N.C.

I've lately been interested in:
- 🖥 selfhosted applications / infrastructure,
- 👐🏽 open source, and
- 🔐 internet security and cryptography

I've always loved science- and fantasy fiction, strategy video + board games, and have a soft spot for the good (and bad) of Bollywood, especially the classics.

## Posts
I'm hoping to write more in 2019. You can see how well that's going [here](/posts).
