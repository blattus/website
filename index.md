# Welcome

Thanks for dropping by! I'm currently based in SF and work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) after a few years at [Index](https://index.com). 

Some fun things I'm into lately are:
- The payments / energy industries
- Crypto and web security
- Classic Bollywood music + movies
- Anything sci-fi / fantasy

If any of that sounds interesting, feel free to get in touch! I'm [roshans](https://keybase.io/roshans) on Keybase for social proof purposes but will also respond to email sent to `roshan.sadanani [at] gmail [dot] com`.
