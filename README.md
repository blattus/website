This is the repo for the code that powers my personal website https://www.roshansadanani.com. If you happened here by chance, the website is probably more interesting. If you happened here by intent, some more details are below:

## Hosting
This website is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme and hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). I made a few modifications to the theme:
- Edited the index page to function as an "about" page with a manual link to posts
- Disabled pagination since I don't seem to need it for now
- Created a posts page that's manually updated (for now) with new posts as they're published
- Added support for FontAwesome icons which are used in the sidebar
- Tweaked some of the code formatting CSS to avoid the agressive text wrapping resulting from the default font size + line spacing

Feel free to open a PR if you notice a typo!
